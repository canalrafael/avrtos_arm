======================================================================
Context
======================================================================

- In which field is my research inserted?

- Why is it relevant?

- What open problems are still there in the field? (Check national agency websites like NSF, EC, CNRS, and recent surveys in top journals for hints.)

- Which of these problems am I going to address in this article?

- How have others addressed this problem so far? (Start building your bibliography.)

- What results have others achieved so far?

- What is still missing?

======================================================================
Problem Statement
======================================================================

Summarize the previous paragraphs in a single, strong, concise, complete, robust statement.

[Your problem statement here]

======================================================================
Envisioned Solution
======================================================================

- How do you think you can solve the problem modeled above?

- Are you going to develop a formal proof?

- Are you going to implement something and validate your solution experimentally? How exactly?

- Are you going to model your solution to run simulations? What exactly will you simulate? How will you achieve statistical significance to make your point?

======================================================================
Hypothesis
======================================================================

Revisit your problem statement, reflect deeply about your envisioned solution, and now write a strong, concise, complete, robust hypothesis that you can demonstrate (or maybe prove) at least partially.

[Your hypothesis here]

======================================================================
Demonstration Strategy (aka Methodology)
======================================================================

- How are you going to demonstrate your hypothesis?

- Which assets do you already have?
  - Literature:
  - Tools, datasets, systems, algorithms, theorems, formulations by others:
  - Previous works by the group (links to other experiments, reports, and papers):
  - Skills:

- What is still missing?

- How will you tackle the missing elements?

- What resources do I need?

- Who can help me and how?

- How long will it take?

======================================================================
Schedule
======================================================================

Plan your work in weeks and keep a progress record. (x = work, D# = deadline/delivery)

Task    | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | W5 | W6 | W7 | W8
--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Task 1  | x  | x  | D1 |    |    |    |    |
Task 2  |    |    | x  | x  | D2 |    |    |
Task 3  |    |    |    |    | x  | x  | D3 |
Task 4  |    |    |    |    |    |    | x  | D4

======================================================================
Progress Tracking - Weekly Log
======================================================================

CODES:
WT = Writing Task; WD = Writing Done; WP = Writing Problems
CT = Coding Task; CD = Coding Done; CP = Coding Problems
RT = Review Task; RD = Review Done; RP = Review Problems
FT = Field Test Task; FD = Field Test Done; FP = Field Test Problem
PT = Planning and Discussion Tasks; PD = Planning and Discussion Done; PP = Planning and Discussion Problem
H = Help needed: what kind of help is required and expected time required (Email/Remote Meet/In-person meet).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Date (dd/mm/yy) | Type | Description
----------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------
dd/mm/yy        | xT   | Planned task (a single line per task for each week).
dd/mm/yy        | xD   | Single-line description of each task finished this week (with links to assets).
dd/mm/yy        | xP   | Single-line description of tasks that could not be accomplished with reasons.
dd/mm/yy        | xH   | Expected Time Required: [details on help needed].

======================================================================
Reporting
======================================================================

Create a document in Overleaf to collect results as you produce them. Remember your hypothesis: things not directly related, even if fundamental, do not usually get reported to avoid zig-zags.
Link: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Creating_a_document_in_Overleaf

Capture your results as if they were finals (don't waste your time with draft figures, tables, graphics that must be remade later).
Link to git repository (for code): [URL]
Link to data repository (e.g., IoT platform, dataset storage): [URL]
Link to documents (e.g., seafile, drive): [URL]

Use Inkscape for figures.
Use 10pt sans-serif fonts for plottings and figures, on an A5 page (so you don't have to resize them for the paper).

======================================================================
Bibliography
======================================================================

Link your bibliography (e.g., a BibTeX file or Zotero library) and write a paragraph for each paper explaining why it was relevant for your hypothesis. This can later be incorporated into the related works section of your article.
